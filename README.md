This program is an AI-powered Legal Consultant application. It allows users to ask any legal question and get a general overview or guidance. The program uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to the user's questions.

The application offers a text area for users to enter their legal question and a dropdown to select the law under which they want the consultancy (options include International, Pakistani, Shariah, Indian, US law).

Once the user submits their question, the program generates a response simulating an experienced lawyer's consultancy regarding the query under the selected law. The response is displayed to the user in an info box.

The program includes a sidebar with the version of the Legal Consultant, contact information for the developer, links to the technologies powering the application (OpenAI and Langchain), and a link to the source code of the application.

The application also includes a disclaimer reminding users that the AI legal consultant provides general information and is not a substitute for professional legal advice. Users are advised to consult with a qualified attorney for specific legal guidance.
